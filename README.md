# Hue

This full-stack application was developed for Hue, an online art gallery and store where users can use AI to create, share, and sell awesome digital artwork and photography. Hueâ€™s AI art  and image models are powered by the MindsDB Dall-E integration, which has been trained on 400 million labeled datasets. 

Hue's AI models were all specially trained to generate artwork in the likeness of specific artists and genres. 
 
Hue was built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5, JavaScript, Python 3, and Django. Hue's checkout functionality is powered by the Stripe API. All AI image generation functionality.

## Testing

### Research & Planning

#### User Stories

User stories were created by the [developer](https://www.github.com/alissatroiano) during the planning phase of this project. As practiced in agile development, each user story coincides with a feature of the Hue application and will be accomplished in one sprint.

#### The following user stories were created for the **shopper**:
