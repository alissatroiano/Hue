# Hue

This full-stack application was developed for Hue, a fictional online art gallery where artists can showcase and sell their artwork online.

As the Milestone 4 Project for [Code Institute's](https://codeinstitute.net) [Full Stack Software Development Diploma Program](https://codeinstitute.net/full-stack-software-development-diploma/), Hue was built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and Django.

## UX

### Summary

The main goal of Hue is to boost revenue by selling subscriptions. Hue's target market is comprised of male & female artists (ages 25-34) that want to display & sell their work online.

### Research & Planning

During the research & planning phase of this milestone project the developer came to the following conclusions:

- Hue should be built for **two** different types of users:
 1) Primary User (aka "The Subscriber")
 - Hue's target market of artists that wish to:
    - Display artwork in the gallery
    - Sell artwork

 2) Secondary User
 - Fans of art that want to:
    - Visit the gallery and view artist submissions
    - Purchase artwork

### User Stories

User stories were created by the [developer](https://www.github.com/alissatroiano) during the planning phase of this project. As practiced in agile development, each user story coincides with a feature of the Hue application and will be accomplished in one sprint.

#### The following user stories were created for the **primary user**:

> As a new shopper, I want to be able to visit the 'About' page, so that I can learn more about the service.
>>
> As a new shopper, I want to be able to find membership information quickly, so that I can learn about Hue's plans.
>>
> As a new shopper, I want to be able to see membership prices & details, so that I can learn how much it costs.
>>
> As a new shopper, I want to be able to quickly find the 'Sign Up' button, so that I can register for the service.
>>
> As a new shopper, I want to be able to select a plan, so that I can purchase a membership.
>>
> As a new shopper, I want to be able to checkout, so that I can activate my subscription.
>>
>>
> As a registered user, I want to login to the application, so I can access my account.
>>
> As a registered user, I want to be able to reset my password, so that I can recover my account.
>>
> As a registered shopper, I want to be able to logout, so that I can leave the application.
>>
> As a registered user, I want to have a personalized profile, so that I can view my orders & update my account.
>>
> As a site owner, I want to be able to easily create new products, so that I can display my work in the gallery.
>>
> As a site owner, I want to be able to edit products, so that I can update my storefront. 
>>
> As a site owner, I want to be able to delete, so that I can remove products from the gallery.
>>
> As a shopper, I want to be able to search, so that I can find artwork.
>>
> As a shopper, I want to be able to sort & filter, so that I can narrow down my search results.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
 - The project uses **Django** to simplify development and scalability.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
 - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
 1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
 2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
 3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
 4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
