# Hue

This full-stack application was developed for Hue, a fictional online art gallery where artists can showcase and sell their artwork.

As the Milestone 4 Project for Code Institute's Full Stack Software Development Program, Hue was built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python and Django.

## UX

The main goal of Hue is to boost revenue by selling subscriptions. Hue's target market is comprised of male & female artists (ages 25-34) that want to display & sell their work online. 

User stories were created by the [developer](https://www.github.com/alissatroiano) during the planning phase of this project. As practiced in agile development, each user story coincides with a feature of the Hue application and will be accomplished in one sprint.

> As a potential user, I want to be able to visit the 'About' page, so that I can learn more about the service.
>>
> As a potential user, I want to be able to find information about different gallery memberships, so that I can determine the best option for me.
>>
> As a potential user, I want to be able to view subscription pricing, so that I can decide whether or not I can afford the service.
>>
> As a new user, I want to be able to select a plan, so I can purchase the plan I want.
>>
> As a new user, I want to be able to register & checkout in less than 3 clicks, so that I can activate my subscription.
>>
> As a registered user, I want to login with ease, so that I can acces & use the service.
>>
> As a registered user, I want to be able to reset my password, so that I can regain access to my account.
>>
> As a registered user, I want to be able to logout, so that I can leave the application.
>>
> As a registered user, I want to be able to view my plan details in my profile, so that I can manage my subscription.
>>
> As a user, I want to be able to easily create new submissions, so I can display my work in the gallery.
>>
> As a user, I want to be able to edit my submissions, so that I can update my showcased work. 
>>
> As a user, I want to be able to delete my submissions, so that I can remove them from the gallery.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
    - The project uses **Django** to simplify development and scalability.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
